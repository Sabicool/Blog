Came across [this journal article on paediatric foreign body ingestion](https://doi.org/10.1177/0009922819829036). In this US paper they reviewed data taken from 1997 to 2015 regarding children (aged 0-17) who presented to ED for foreign body ingestion. What was most interesting about this paper was that:

> An increase in CFBI [Christmas foreign body ingestion] occurred in the 7-week block surrounding Christmas, with peak ingestion rates ... noted in the days prior to Christmas ...

Among the most commonly ingested were non-electric Christmas decorations such as ornaments, bells, candles, snow globes etc.

The main limitation of this study was that they only used data from EDs only potentially underestimating rates of foreign body ingestion because of children who might present to primary care clinics. This might be of particular concern because these clinics may close or operate at limited times around Christmas, directing more patients to present to the ED. Nonetheless, a worthwhile read.


## Concluding Remarks {#concluding-remarks}

Main source was just the main paper: <https://doi.org/10.1177/0009922819829036>. Had a look at oxford handbook of clinical specialties as well.

This was a much shorter and light hearted blog post. That being said, with the completion of 2021[^fn:1], my upcoming posts should be longer and more reflective.

[^fn:1]: I think it a bit weird that the entire world celebrates the passage of time just by the revolution of the Earth around the Sun. The passage of time in my opinion can always be appreciated.

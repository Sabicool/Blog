Came across [this journal article on paediatric foreign body ingestion](https://doi.org/10.1177/0009922819829036). In this US paper they reviewed data taken from 1997 to 2015 regarding children (aged 0-17) who presented to ED for foreign body ingestion. What was most interesting about this paper was that:

> An increase in CFBI [Christmas foreign body ingestion] occurred in the 7-week block surrounding Christmas, with peak ingestion rates ... noted in the days prior to Christmas ...

Among the most commonly ingested were non-electric Christmas decorations such as ornaments, bells, candles, snow globes etc.

The main limitation of this study was that they only used data from EDs only potentially underestimating rates of foreign body ingestion because of children who might present to primary care clinics. This might be of particular concern because these clinics may close or operate at limited times around Christmas, directing more patients to present to the ED. Nonetheless, a worthwhile read.

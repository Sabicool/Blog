## Introduction {#introduction}

Have not been making as many blog posts as I anticipated. Its always the start of university that is a bit busy, but hopefully things are starting to get less chaotic.

I was reading the book Deep Work by Cal Newport and came across the idea of setting boundaries. In essence he presents the idea that you should set times for work and not work outside of those time constraints.

> It follows, therefore, that by evening, you're beyond the point where you can continue to effectively work deeply. Any work you do fit into the night, thereofre, won't be the type of high-value activities that really advance your career; your efforts will instead likely be confined to low-value shallow tasks (executed at a slow, low-energy pace). By deferring evening work, in other words, you're not missing out on much of importance


## Giving it a go {#giving-it-a-go}

I figured I should attempt this concept. My implementation was simple, don't do any work that required deep focus in the evening beyond 6PM. The rule was simple, and success should have been straightforward.

Unfortunately, as much as I hate to admit it, the rule wasn't so simple. I attempted to follow this rule for 2 weeks with two minor changes to the rule:

1.  I am allowed to do some time sensitive admin work in the evening
2.  I can do my flashcards if I haven't already completed them earlier in the day

This meant that I could only do things like learning new content, reviwing lectures and writing earlier in the day. As much as this concept probably works well for people who have control over their entire day, I do not have such a luxury. My classes dictate my energy level and time spent studying each day so setting a confined rule for every day does not work so well.


## My changes {#my-changes}

Before I elaborate on how I worked around these problems I identified, I must bring importance to what Cal Newport describes as the "shutdown ritual"

> ... this ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been viewed and that for each you have confirmed either (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it's captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right

The specifics of your shutdown ritual varies depending on your task management system, but for me as an overarching process, I check a few things:

1.  Review my agenda for today and move uncompleted items to another day or update their progress
2.  Process my inbox of tasks and thoughts I've collected throughout the day
3.  Look through emails, slack and teams (and other communication platforms)
4.  Check my calendar for any pending items and anything special tomorrow
5.  Decide on tasks that I will do tomorrow and schedule these in my calendar
6.  Briefly look through all the tasks I need to complete in general

I figured that setting a fixed time as the end of my day was not practical in my case. So what I've figured is that I can either set a fixed time for each day of the week (i.e. Monday 7pm, Tuesday 6pm, Wednesday 8pm, Thursday 5pm etc.), but this didn't work either. Mainly because I have variety between my weeks in general.

What I figured worked best for me is to set say a certain number of hours of deep work to do each week (I've currently set it at 21 hours, so average of 3 hours of deep work per day). I found this to be more of a stress relief technique than as a productivity technique. Regardless it did a few things for me:

1.  Set an upper limit for time studying. This way I don't end up studying a lot one day and feeling burnt out for the next few days
2.  More flexible planning and allows me to _"catch up"_ on studying if I so wish from a previous day if I had plans or something happened
3.  Gives me a means to be on top of my studies while also doing the essentials (e.g. sleeping enough hours, cooking etc.) as well as working, helping with societies, doing research and socialising

I don't factor in doing flashcards into this deep focus time of 21 hours because I don't have to be very concentrated to do them and I can do them whenever.

The other part to this I've taken, is that each day after my last deep focus task, I do my _shutdown ritual_ and decide then and there that I will not do any more draining or deep tasks. This gives me time to just relax in the evenings and really just give the opportunity for my brain to rest.


## In Conclusion {#in-conclusion}

In summary, the rules I follow:

1.  Getting a set few hours of deep focused work done every week. I'm not too concerned if I don't hit this target but I'm more concerned about going wildly over this target (with the exception probably being around exam time)
2.  A shutdown ritual each which signals to my brain that no more deep work is to be done for today

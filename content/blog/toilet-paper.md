## The Problem {#the-problem}

So one day, sitting on the toilet I found myself in the all too familiar conundrum: _"Should I shout out for someone to bring me a new roll and at the same time bring dishonour and embarrassment to thyself"_.

More pertinent to this blog post, however was that I thought we had a somewhat thick toilet paper roll yesterday. Was someone hoarding toilet paper? But, doesn't it feel like toilet paper gets used up much more quickly towards the end of the roll than compared to the beginning? This is the question we shall answer in this blog post:

> Why does toilet paper feel like it runs out really fast near the end?


## The Solution {#the-solution}

Some of you would already propose the answer as one of basic geometry. At the beginning, the radius of the toilet paper is large so one arc length carries a larger amount of toilet paper roll than compared to near the end. But have you bothered to do the maths behind it? No, didn't think so.

Let's set up some constants:


## Heading 1 {#heading-1}

test of some sample text with a maths formula below:

\\[
\int\_0^\infty x\cdot dx=\frac{1}{1+x^2}
\\]

-   some bullet
-   points as Welland
-   further bullet points


### Sub heading {#sub-heading}

with more text and a chemical formula \\(\ce{H2O <=> 2H+}\\)


## Outer heading {#outer-heading}

hopefulyl that's cool enough for this

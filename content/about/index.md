# About
I'm a 2nd year medical student studying in Australia. I don't believe you should be defined by your job or degree, so for me I don't consider myself defined by this. For one, I have this blog where I get to showcase my interests in other topics like chemistry, mathematics, productivity, programming and philosophy. Outside of this, I enjoy playing football, ultimate frisbee and the guitar. 

## What I'm working on
1. Getting through medicine and working on becoming a doctor in the near future
2. On this website I write articles about productivity, medicine, and science
3. I am in charge of IT for the medical and surgical society at my university
3. Helping run a state conference for medical students
4. I collaborate on medical research

## Other Stuff
1. At university I learnt to make, design and host websites
2. I learned to write and typeset textbooks when I was 16 and have been writing technical books, papers and exams since
3. I learnt to code aged 15 when I was making an automated sprinkler system that won me a young scientist's award among others (see [here if you so please](https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/‘smart-sprinkler’-wins-national-engineering-competition))

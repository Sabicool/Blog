I'm a 3rd year medical student studying in Australia. Saying this, my interests are not just limited to medicine and so this blog exists as a way for me to explore my own thoughts and showcase different insights on different interests of mine. My interests include (though, not limited to): ethics, sciences, mathematics, productivity and workflow, programming and philosophy.

## What I'm working on
1. Getting through medicine and working on becoming a doctor in the near future
2. On this website I write articles about productivity, medicine, and science
3. I am involved in some collaborative medical research
4. I am part of some medical societies in roles such as IT director and treasurer

## Other Stuff
1. At university I learnt to make, design and host websites
2. I learned to write and typeset textbooks in 2018 and have been writing technical books, papers and exams since
3. I began learning to code in 2016 and have won some engineering competitions when I was younger.

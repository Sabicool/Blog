title: "About Me"
---

Hi! I'm Sab, a junior doctor in Australia who loves tinkering with code, building elaborate systems, and making things unnecessarily complex (but in a fun way!).

When I'm not working in medicine, you'll find me reconfiguring Emacs for the hundredth time, organizing my notes in increasingly elaborate ways, or playing Pokémon.

This blog is my digital garden where I plant half-formed ideas, document my projects, and occasionally share medical curiosities. Welcome! ✨

Hi, I’m Sab.

I’m a doctor who likes programming, building things, and taking perfectly functional systems (especially my Emacs config) and “improving” them late at night.

This site is a personal corner of the internet for:
- Writing short blog posts and notes
- Documenting projects and half-finished ideas
- Collecting things I find interesting or nice to look at

My interests include medicine and medical ethics, reading, Pokémon, planes, and generally tinkering with software until it either works better or teaches me something.

Nothing here is optimised, polished, or finished on purpose. It’s a place to think out loud, build in public, and keep a small piece of the web that feels like mine.

Welcome! ✨

title: "Welcome to my blog~!"
intro: 
  - "I’m a junior doctor in Australia with a fondness for small, unnecessary projects: tinkering with code, endlessly reconfiguring Emacs, and building elaborate note systems that mostly exist to make me happy. I like cats, Pokémon (especially the comforting, pixelated ones), and the quiet joy of making confusing things feel a little clearer. This blog is a place for side quests, half-formed ideas, and gentle curiosities—about learning, making things, and occasionally medicine 🐱"
  - "P.S. This website looks way better on desktop"

The first free peer-reviewed collaborative Anki deck for Australian and New Zealand medical students and junior doctors.

<!--more-->

Malleus Clinical Medicine is an attempt to make medical revision more accurate, contextual, and locally relevant. The deck is built around Australian and New Zealand guidelines, common exam frameworks, and real clinical reasoning rather than trivia accumulation. Content is peer-reviewed, continuously revised, and designed to grow alongside training rather than be discarded after exams. More details about the project are on the website [malleus.org.au](malleus.org.au).

Beyond the cards themselves, a significant part of the project has been building tooling to make creating, maintaining, and using the deck easier and more sustainable. To that end, I’ve developed:
- [Malleus Anki Addon](https://github.com/Sabicool/Malleus-Anki-Addon)
- [Malleus Chrome Extension](https://github.com/Sabicool/Malleus-Extension)
- [Malleus Note Type](https://github.com/Sabicool/Malleus-Note-Type)
